# A machine learning web app for salary prediction using random forest regressor.

In this project I will build an Machine Learning app utilize the "The Public 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results" for predicting the salary of a developer based on chosen attributes.

A short overview:

Step 1: Preprocessing of the dataset and make it suitable for training the ML model.

Step 2: Adopt Random Forest Regressor as the ML algorithm and select the hyper-parameter using Grid Search CV.

Step 2: Create and launch locally the web application using Streamlit.


# To run the web app
Please go to the terminal where you have saved this project (the trained model is also present in this repository) and execute the following command:

```
streamlit run main.py
```
